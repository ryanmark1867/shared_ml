" ""I had big expectations because I love English TV, in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring. It didn't appeal to me at all."",",0.000850255,0.99914968
" ""I highly recommend this series. It is a must for anyone who is yearning to watch grown up television. Complex characters and plots to keep one totally involved. Thank you Amazin Prime."",",0.997842789,0.002157163
" ""This one is a real snoozer. Don't believe anything you read or hear, it's awful. I had no idea what the title means. Neither will you."",",0.000876134,0.999123871
" ""Mysteries are interesting.  The tension between Robson and the tall blond is good but not always believable.  She often seemed uncomfortable."",",0.001653792,0.99834621
" ""This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent prayer of the bon which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these"",",0.983478904,0.016521085

" ""There are many episodes in this series, so I pretty-much just skip through them to try to find a description of something I think I would like.  It's kind of a crap shoot as to whether you'll be entertained or not, but hey, if you're just sitting around trying to kill 20-30 minutes while you're waiting for something else to do, it's worth a shot."",",0.994566083,0.005433918

" ""All the comedians are hilarious. I have seen them all before on Comedy Central but what a great idea to put them all together. I love Amazon prime and I love their shows. They are so much better than Netflix. I got rid of my Netflix Amazon rocks and Netflix well it thymes with rocks but in a bad way."",",0.003292189,0.996707797
" ""There were some good entertainers, and some are just dumb.  I kept a paper and pen and wrote down names of the ones I wanted to see more.  They keep them in fairly short bits.  If you are looking to laugh continuous this may not be for you.  But each person has a different sense of humor so give it a try, but don't expect greatness."",",0.005004801,0.994995236
